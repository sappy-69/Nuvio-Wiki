# Stream Badges Guide

Nuvio uses a fully customizable, image and color-based tagging layer for badges that scans each stream's title or filename and displays visual badges on your stream selection screen. Badges are not fixed or built in; they come from a **JSON configuration file** that you import via a URL.

> [!NOTE]
> Badges are community-created and fully customizable. The colors, icons, and labels you see depend entirely on the badge set you have imported. Nuvio has no hard-coded badge colors or styles.

---

## How the Badge System Works

When you open the stream selection screen, Nuvio reads the title text returned by your addon for each result. It then runs each title through a list of **regex patterns** defined in your badge JSON. When a pattern matches, Nuvio displays the corresponding badge image and color next to that stream entry.

The badge JSON is hosted at a URL (e.g., on GitHub) and imported once into your Nuvio settings. You can import up to **3 separate badge JSON URLs** simultaneously, allowing you to layer badge sets from multiple sources.

---

## Setting Up Badges

### Where to find the setting

Navigate to one of these locations depending on your Nuvio version:

- Mobile: **Settings → Streams → Badge URL**
- TV: **Settings → Layout → Streams → Badge URL**

### How to import

1. Obtain a badge JSON URL (see [Community Badge Sets](#community-badge-sets) below).
2. Open Nuvio and go to the Badge URL field in settings.
3. Paste the direct URL to the `.json` file.
4. Press **Import**.
5. You should see a confirmation such as `1/3 URLs imported`.


> [!TIP]
> Always use the **raw** GitHub/Gist URL for badge JSON files. The URL should start with `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/...` — not the standard GitHub page URL, which returns HTML, not the JSON content.

---

## Community Badge Sets

These are the most widely used and recommended badge configurations in the Nuvio community. If you prefer not to import a raw URL directly, see the [Badge Editor Tools](#badge-editor-tools) section below for web-based tools that let you browse, preview, and customize these sets visually.

### NardBadges

### BetterFormatter

A highly configurable badge and formatter toolkit with 32 preset variants covering colored and monochrome styles across multiple layout modes — maintained by [9mousaa](https://github.com/9mousaa/BetterFormatter). Also includes a [web-based configurator](https://9mousaa.github.io/BetterFormatter/) for generating custom presets.

BetterFormatter presets follow a naming convention: `{style}-{layout}-{mode}-{dv}.json`

- **Style:** `colored` (category-based colors) or `mono` (monochrome)
- **Layout:** `bgb` (badge-based), `pct` (percentage), `src` (source), `tier` (tier-based)
- **Mode:** `combo` (combined) or `sep` (separated)
- **DV handling:** `always` (always show DV badge) or `nodv` (hide DV badge)

| Variant | URL |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Colored Badge Combo** (no DV) | `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/9mousaa/BetterFormatter/main/presets/colored-bgb-combo-nodv.json` |
| **Colored Badge Combo** (always DV) | `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/9mousaa/BetterFormatter/main/presets/colored-bgb-combo-always.json` |
| **Mono Badge Combo** (no DV) | `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/9mousaa/BetterFormatter/main/presets/mono-bgb-combo-nodv.json` |
| **Mono Badge Combo** (always DV) | `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/9mousaa/BetterFormatter/main/presets/mono-bgb-combo-always.json` |

**Preview:**

| Colored Style | Mono Style |

## What Badges Display

The badge system recognizes metadata parsed directly from stream titles. Badges are typically organized into these categories:

| Category | Examples |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Resolution** | 4K, 2K, FHD, HD, 576p, 480p, 360p, 240p, 144p |
| **Quality / Source** | Remux, BluRay, WebDL, WebRip, HDRip, HC HDRip, DVDRip, HDTV, SCR, TC, TS, CAM |
| **IMAX** | IMAX Enhanced, IMAX |
| **Visual / HDR** | Dolby Vision, HDR10+, HDR10, HDR, SDR, 10bit, HLG, AI |
| **Audio** | ATMOS / TrueHD, DTS:X / DTS-HD MA, ATMOS / DD+, TrueHD, DD+, DD, DTS-HD MA, DTS-HD, DTS-ES, DTS, FLAC, OPUS, AAC |
| **Channels** | 7.1, 6.1, 5.1, 2.0, 1.0 |
| **Encoder** | AV1, HEVC, AVC, XviD, DivX |
| **Language** | Various language flags depending on the badge set |

Badges are only displayed if the stream title contains text that matches the badge's regex pattern. If your addon does not include quality information in stream titles, badges may not appear.

---

## Badge Priority Hierarchy

When a stream title matches multiple badges in the same category, Nuvio uses a **priority hierarchy** to determine which single badge to display. The hierarchy shown below is the order in which Nuvio will select the displayed badge — the first match wins.

### Resolution

```
4K → 2K → FHD → HD → 576p → 480p → 360p → 240p → 144p
```

### Quality / Source

```
Remux → BluRay → WebDL → WebRip → HDRip → HC HDRip → DVDRip → HDTV → SCR → TC → TS → CAM
```

### IMAX

```
IMAX Enhanced → IMAX
```

### Visual / HDR

```
Dolby Vision  ─┐
HDR10+        ─┘→ HDR10 → HDR → SDR

10bit → HLG → AI  (separate track)
```

### Audio (Dolby track)

```
ATMOS / TrueHD → ATMOS / DD+ → TrueHD → DD+ → DD
```

### Audio (DTS track)

```
DTS:X / DTS-HD MA → DTS-HD MA → DTS-HD → DTS-ES → DTS
```

### Audio (Other)

```
FLAC → OPUS → AAC
```

### Channels

```
7.1 → 6.1 → 5.1 → 2.0 → 1.0
```

### Encoder

```
AV1 → HEVC → AVC → XviD → DivX
```

> [!NOTE]
> This hierarchy is determined by the order of entries in your badge JSON file. Badge sets like NardBadges are already ordered correctly. If you build a custom set, place higher-priority badges earlier in the `filters` array.

---

## Creating Custom Badges

If you prefer to write your own badge JSON, Nuvio uses the following schema:

```json
{
  "filters": [
    {
      "id": "unique-badge-id",
      "groupId": "resolution",
      "name": "4K",
      "pattern": "(?i)\\b(4k|2160p|uhd)\\b",
      "imageURL": "https://example.com/badges/4k.png",
      "tagColor": "#33FFFFFF",
      "borderColor": "#FFAAAAAA"
    }
  ]
}
```

| Field | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `id` | A unique string identifier for this badge entry. |
| `groupId` | The category group (e.g., `resolution`, `audio`, `visual`). Only one badge per group is shown per stream. |
| `name` | The display label used for accessibility and fallback text. |
| `pattern` | A **regex** pattern matched against the stream title. Use `(?i)` for case-insensitive matching. |
| `imageURL` | A direct URL to the badge image (PNG recommended). |
| `tagColor` | Background color in `#AARRGGBB` format (alpha first). |
| `borderColor` | Border color in `#AARRGGBB` format (alpha first). |

> [!TIP]
> Colors in the JSON use Android's `#AARRGGBB` format — the first two hex digits are **alpha (opacity)**, not the standard web `#RRGGBB`. For example, `#FF0877F9` is fully opaque Nuvio blue, while `#330877F9` is 20% opacity blue.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `groupId` field controls badge exclusivity. Only one badge per `groupId` is shown per stream entry. Badges within the same group compete based on their order in the `filters` array — the first match wins. Place higher-priority badges earlier in the list.

---

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
| :--- | :--- |
| Badges not appearing after import | Ensure you are using the **raw** GitHub URL (starts with `raw.githubusercontent.com`). |
| Badge URL disappears after saving | Known bug — import the URL and **exit without pressing Save**. |
| Badges showing but wrong priority | The badge set's `filters` array order controls priority. Re-order entries or use Badger to adjust. |
| No badges on streams from a specific addon | The addon may not include quality metadata in stream titles. Check the addon's output format. |
| Badges look different from screenshots | Badge appearance depends on the set you imported. Colors and icons are fully customizable — different sets look different. |
