# Troubleshooting Guide

Find solutions to common issues with Nuvio below. Problems are grouped by category — jump to the section most relevant to your situation.

> [!TIP]
> Before diving into specific fixes, try the most common quick fixes first: **restart the app**, **check your internet connection**, and **verify your Debrid subscription is active**. These resolve the majority of reported issues.

---

## Quick Diagnostics

Run through this checklist before troubleshooting anything specific:

1. **Is your internet connection stable?** Run a speed test. Streaming typically requires 5–25 Mbps depending on quality.
2. **Is your Debrid subscription active and not expired?** Log in to your provider's website to confirm.
3. **Are your addons enabled?** Open Nuvio → Settings → Addons and verify they are toggled on.
4. **Is the app up to date?** Check for the latest Nuvio release and install it.
5. **Have you tried clearing the app cache?** Go to your device's System Settings → Apps → Nuvio → Clear Cache.

If none of these resolve your issue, continue to the relevant section below.

## 1. Playback Issues

### 1.1 Video Stutters or Buffers

Buffering is the most common complaint and almost always has a fixable cause. Work through the steps below in order.

**Step 1 — Confirm your Debrid service is connected** [Debrid Integration Only]

Nuvio relies on a Debrid service (e.g., Torbox, Real-Debrid, AllDebrid) to deliver high-quality, cached streams. Without one, streams are sourced from slower public peers.

- Open **Settings → Debrid** and verify your provider is listed and authenticated.
- If it shows an error, log out and re-authenticate.

**Step 2 — Check your internet speed**

Use a speed test app or visit a speed test site in your device's browser.

- For 1080p playback, aim for at least **10 Mbps**.
- For 4K/HDR, aim for at least **25 Mbps**.
- If your speed is consistently low, the issue is your connection, not Nuvio. Try moving closer to your router or switching from Wi-Fi to a wired connection.

**Step 3 — Clear the app cache**

A corrupted or oversized cache can cause playback to stall.

- On Android/Fire TV: **Device Settings → Applications → Nuvio → Clear Cache**.
- On mobile: **Device Settings → General → iPhone Storage → Nuvio → Offload App** [iOS Only], or **Settings → Apps → Nuvio → Storage → Clear Cache** [Android Mobile Only].
- Restart Nuvio after clearing.

**Step 4 — Toggle tunneled playback** [Android TV Only]

If your network filters or throttles video traffic, tunneled playback can help route around it.

- Go to **Settings → Playback** and toggle the **Tunneled Playback** option on or off.
- Test with it both enabled and disabled to see which performs better on your network.

**Step 5 — Adjust Auto Frame Rate (AFR) settings** [Android TV Only]

Mismatched frame rates between the stream and your display can cause judder or dropped frames that look like buffering.

- Go to **Settings → Player → Auto Frame Rate** and experiment with the available options.
- If your TV/display does not support AFR well, disabling it entirely may give smoother results.

**Step 6 — Toggle "Fast Subtitle Startup"**

Some subtitle tracks are loaded during buffering and can delay or interrupt stream startup.

- Go to **Settings → Subtitles** and toggle **Fast Subtitle Startup** off.
- Test whether playback starts more reliably.

**Step 7 — Try an external player**

If Nuvio's built-in player continues to struggle, offloading to a dedicated player can help.

- Install **VLC** or **MX Player** from your device's app store.
- In Nuvio, go to **Settings → Player → External Player** and select your installed player.
- Try playing the same content again.

> [!NOTE]
> External players handle certain codecs (HEVC, AV1, Dolby Vision) differently. If the internal player buffers on a specific stream but an external player doesn't, the issue is codec-related rather than network-related.

---

### 1.2 No Audio or Black Screen

A black screen or missing audio usually points to a codec or renderer incompatibility rather than a network problem.

**Step 1 — Switch to an external player**

This is the fastest fix for codec-related rendering failures.

- Go to **Settings → Player → External Player** and select **VLC** or **MX Player**.
- Return to the content and try playing it again.

**Step 2 — Check audio output settings** [Android TV Only]

If video plays but there is no audio, your audio output mode may not be compatible with the stream.

- Go to **Settings → Player → Audio** and try changing between **Stereo**, **Surround (Passthrough)**, ect.
- If you are on a TV, check that your HDMI cable supports audio return (ARC/eARC) and that the TV's audio settings are not muted or set to an unsupported format.

**Step 3 — Try a different stream**

Sometimes a specific stream file is malformed. Use the stream picker (available during playback) to select an alternate source for the same content.

---

### 1.3 "No Streams Found"

This message means Nuvio queried your addons and received no usable results. There are several possible causes.

**Step 1 — Verify addons are enabled**

- Go to **Settings → Addons** and confirm at least one streaming addon is toggled on.
- If the list is empty, you will need to add an addon by entering its manifest URL.

**Step 2 — Confirm your Debrid subscription is valid**

Many addons filter out non-Debrid results by default. An expired or disconnected Debrid account will cause most streams to be hidden.

- Log in to your Debrid provider's website and check your account status.
- Re-authenticate in Nuvio under **Settings → Debrid** if necessary. [Debrid Integration Only]

**Step 3 — Try a different content source**

Different addons index different sources. If one addon shows no results:

- Switch to another enabled addon from the source picker.
- If you only have one addon, consider adding a second one for redundancy.

**Step 4 — Check whether the content is newly released**

Newly released movies and TV episodes may not yet be cached or indexed by Debrid providers or addon sources. This is expected behavior and not a bug.

- Wait 24–72 hours after a release date and try again.
- Some content may only appear after wider release (e.g., after a streaming exclusive window ends).

**Step 5 — Check your addon's configuration**

Some addons (e.g., AIOStreams) require specific configuration tied to your Debrid credentials. If the addon was recently reconfigured or your API key changed:

- Re-enter your addon manifest URL with updated credentials.
- Refer to the [Debrid Integration Guide](debrid-integration.md) for your specific provider.

> [!WARNING]
> Do not share your addon manifest URL publicly — it typically contains your Debrid API key or account token.

---

### 1.4 Poor Video Quality

If content plays but the quality is lower than expected (e.g., 480p instead of 1080p):

- **Check your Debrid provider's cache.** Not all content is cached in every quality. Open the stream picker and look for higher-quality options.
- **Review your addon quality filters.** Some addons have quality caps set during configuration. Re-configure your addon to allow 1080p or 4K sources.
- **Check your network speed.** Your connection may not support the highest quality tier available. A stable 25+ Mbps connection is recommended for 4K.

---

### 1.5 Subtitles Not Working

**Subtitles not appearing:**

- Go to **Settings → Subtitles** and confirm subtitles are enabled.
- During playback, open the player menu and check whether a subtitle track is selected.
- If no tracks are listed, the content may not have embedded subtitles. Nuvio may not have fetched external subtitles — check your subtitle source settings.

**Subtitles are out of sync:**

- Use the subtitle delay/offset control in the playback menu to nudge timing forward or backward.
- If sync is consistently off for all content, check whether your player's audio delay setting is also offset.

**Subtitles cause stuttering at startup:**

- Toggle off **Fast Subtitle Startup** in **Settings → Subtitles** (see [Section 1.1](#11-video-stutters-or-buffers), Step 7).

---

### 1.6 Wrong Audio Track Playing

If dialogue is in the wrong language or the wrong audio track is selected by default:

- Open the playback menu during the stream and switch the **Audio Track** to the correct language or channel layout.
- To set a default: go to **Settings → Player → Default Audio Language** and select your preferred language.

---

## 2. App & Installation

### 2.1 "App Not Installed" Error

This error occurs during installation and usually has one of two causes.

**Cause 1 — Wrong APK version**

Nuvio has separate builds for different device types. Installing the wrong version triggers this error.

- **Android phones/tablets:** Use the **Mobile** APK.
- **Android TV, Fire TV, Google TV:** Use the **TV** APK.
- **Samsung Tizen (via TizenBrew):** Use the Tizen-specific installation process — see the [Tizen Installation Guide](tizen-installation.md).

Download the correct version from the [official releases page](official-links.md).

**Cause 2 — Insufficient storage space**

- Check your device's available storage under **Device Settings → Storage**.
- Free up at least 500 MB before attempting installation.
- On Android, you may also need to clear the package installer's own cache.

**Cause 3 — Signature conflict (upgrade scenario)**

If you are upgrading from an older version signed with a different key:

- Uninstall the existing version of Nuvio first.
- Reinstall the new APK from scratch.

> [!CAUTION]
> Uninstalling the app will clear locally stored settings. Export your configuration or note your addon URLs before uninstalling.

---

### 2.2 App Crashes on Launch

**Step 1 — Clear the app cache and data**

- Go to **Device Settings → Apps → Nuvio → Storage → Clear Cache**.
- If the crash persists, tap **Clear Data** (this resets the app to defaults).

**Step 2 — Check for OS compatibility**

Nuvio requires a minimum Android version. Check the release notes for the version you are installing to confirm your device's OS version is supported.

**Step 3 — Reinstall the app**

If clearing data does not help:

- Uninstall Nuvio completely.
- Reboot your device.
- Download the latest APK and reinstall.

**Step 4 — Check for conflicting apps**

Some VPN or firewall apps running in the background can block Nuvio from initializing. Temporarily disable any active VPN or DNS filtering app and test whether Nuvio launches successfully.

---

### 2.3 App Won't Update

- If updating via an APK: ensure you are downloading the correct variant (Mobile vs. TV) and that **Install from Unknown Sources** is enabled in your device settings.
- If updating via a store (where applicable): force-stop the store app, clear its cache, and try again.
- If an older version is blocking the update due to a signing mismatch: uninstall the old version first, then install the new one.

---

### 2.4 Login / Account Issues

- If your Nuvio account shows as logged out after an app update, re-enter your credentials in **Settings → Account**.
- If you have forgotten your password, use the password reset flow at the official site.
- Ensure the date and time on your device are accurate. Authentication tokens can fail if your device clock is significantly off.

---

## 3. Sync & Trakt Issues

### 3.1 Trakt Sync Not Working

Trakt is used to sync your watch history, progress, and ratings across devices. If sync appears broken:

**Step 1 — Re-authenticate Trakt**

- Go to **Settings → Integrations → Trakt**.
- Tap **Log Out**, then **Log In** and complete the authorization flow again.
- This refreshes your access token and resolves the majority of Trakt sync failures.

**Step 2 — Check Trakt's service status**

Trakt occasionally experiences outages. If re-authentication does not help, check [Trakt's status page](https://trakt.tv) or community forums for reported issues.

**Step 3 — Confirm sync is enabled**

- In **Settings → Integrations → Trakt**, ensure that **Auto Sync** is toggled on for both scrobbling and history.

---

### 3.2 Watch Progress Not Saving

- Confirm that Trakt integration is active and authenticated (see above).
- Nuvio scrobbles progress when you reach a certain threshold of a video. Playing only a few seconds may not trigger a scrobble.
- If you are using an external player, scrobbling may not be supported. Switch back to the internal player for automatic progress tracking.

---

### 3.3 Library or Watchlist Not Updating

- Pull-to-refresh your library or watchlist screen.
- Go to **Settings → Integrations → Trakt → Sync Now** to force a manual sync.
- If items added on another device are not appearing, confirm both devices are authenticated to the same Trakt account.

---

## 4. Addon Issues

### 4.1 Manifest URL Error

If Nuvio displays an error when you try to add an addon:

- **Check the URL format.** The URL must begin with `https://` (not `http://`). Even a single incorrect character will cause the manifest to fail to load.
- **Check for trailing spaces.** Copy the URL carefully — invisible trailing spaces can break the request.
- **Verify the addon server is online.** Paste the URL directly into a browser. You should see a JSON manifest. If you see an error or timeout, the addon server may be down.
- **Check your network.** Some addon servers are geo-restricted. If you are using a VPN, try with it disabled, or enable it if the server is in a restricted region.

---

### 4.2 Addons Disappeared After Update

After a Nuvio update, addon configurations are sometimes reset.

- Re-add your addon manifest links manually via **Settings → Addons → Add Addon**.
- Community addon manifest URLs can change. Check the [Official Channels](official-links.md) for the most current URLs.

> [!TIP]
> Keep a personal note of your addon manifest URLs, especially for self-hosted or custom-configured addons where the URL includes your personal API key or configuration hash.

---

### 4.3 Addon Returns No Results

If an addon is installed and enabled but never returns streams:

- Re-check the addon configuration. Many addons (e.g., AIOStreams) are configured with your Debrid credentials baked into the manifest URL. If your API key has changed or expired, you need to regenerate the manifest URL.
- Look at whether the addon is specifically for movies, TV, or both. Some addons only index certain content types.
- For self-hosted addons, verify the server is reachable and running. Check its logs for errors if you have access.

---

### 4.4 Addon Loads Slowly

Slow addon responses extend the time it takes for the stream list to appear.

- Addons hosted in distant regions will have higher latency. Where possible, prefer addons with servers geographically close to you.
- Some community addons run on low-resource servers and will simply be slow during peak hours.
- If you self-host an addon, check its server resource usage and logs.

---

## 5. Debrid Service Issues

### 5.1 Debrid Not Connecting [Debrid Integration Only]

- Go to **Settings → Debrid** and check the status indicator next to your provider.
- If it shows disconnected or an error, tap to re-authenticate.
- Verify your API key is still valid by logging in to your provider's website. Some providers rotate API keys periodically or after a password change.
- If you use a VPN, confirm your VPN's IP is not blocked by your Debrid provider. Some Debrid services block VPN IP ranges to enforce their terms of service.

---

### 5.2 Subscription Expired or Unrecognized

- Log in directly to your Debrid provider's website to confirm your subscription status.
- If you recently renewed, it may take a few minutes to propagate. Log out of Nuvio's Debrid integration and back in to refresh.
- Ensure you are using the **API key** where required, not your login password.

---

### 5.3 Downloaded or Cached Content Not Playing

- Verify that the content is actually cached by your Debrid provider. Not all torrents/sources are cached.
- Some Debrid services have download limits or restrict playback after a quota is reached. Check your provider's account dashboard.
- Try selecting a different stream from the stream picker — there may be an alternate cached source available.

---

## 6. Connectivity & Network Issues

### 6.1 General Connectivity Problems

If Nuvio cannot reach its servers or load any content at all:

- Confirm your device has an active internet connection by opening a browser and loading a website.
- Restart your router and/or modem if the connection seems unstable.
- Try switching between Wi-Fi and mobile data to isolate whether the issue is specific to one connection type.
- Check whether the issue affects other apps as well. If only Nuvio is affected, the problem may be DNS-related.

---

### 6.2 VPN Conflicts

VPNs are a common source of intermittent connectivity and playback issues.

- **Try disabling your VPN** temporarily to test whether it is the cause.
- If Nuvio works without the VPN, your VPN's servers may be throttling video traffic or your Debrid provider may be blocking VPN IPs.
- If you must use a VPN, try switching to a different server or protocol (e.g., WireGuard instead of OpenVPN).
- Some Debrid providers explicitly prohibit use through VPNs in their terms of service.

---

### 6.3 Slow Stream Speeds

If streams load but are consistently slow regardless of content:

- Run a speed test from the same device. If your measured speed is much lower than your subscribed plan, the issue is your ISP or local network, not Nuvio.
- Check whether your ISP throttles video streaming traffic. A VPN may help in this case (test with and without).
- Switch from Wi-Fi to a wired Ethernet connection where possible, particularly on TV devices.
- On Wi-Fi, move closer to your router or switch to a 5 GHz network if your device supports it.

---

## 7. Performance Issues

### 7.1 App Running Slowly or Feeling Sluggish

- **Clear the app cache.** Over time, cached data accumulates and can slow navigation.
- **Reduce background apps.** Close other apps running in the background to free up RAM.
- **Check storage.** Devices with less than 500 MB of free storage often see degraded app performance. Free up space and restart.
- **Disable animations** in your device's developer settings if your hardware is older or underpowered.

---

### 7.2 High Memory Usage or Battery Drain

- Hardware acceleration reduces CPU load during playback and typically improves battery life on supported devices. Ensure it is enabled under **Settings → Player → Hardware Acceleration**.
- Avoid leaving Nuvio running in the background indefinitely. Close it fully when not in use.
- On Android, check **Battery Settings → Battery Usage** to confirm Nuvio is the source of drain and not a background service.

---

## 8. Platform-Specific Issues

### 8.1 Android Phone & Tablet

- **Sideloading:** Nuvio is distributed as an APK. Enable **Install from Unknown Sources** under **Settings → Security** (or **Settings → Apps → Special App Access → Install Unknown Apps**) before installing.
- **Picture-in-Picture (PiP):** If PiP does not work, go to **Device Settings → Apps → Nuvio → Picture-in-Picture** and enable it.
- **Orientation lock:** If the app is stuck in portrait or landscape mode, check your system-level screen rotation lock.

---

### 8.2 Android TV / Fire TV / Google TV

- Always use the **TV build** of Nuvio. The Mobile build will not install or function correctly on TV devices.
- **Remote navigation:** If certain UI elements are unreachable with a remote, try enabling **TV Mode** in Nuvio's settings if available.
- **Fire TV:** If installation is blocked, go to **Settings → My Fire TV → Developer Options → Install Unknown Apps → Nuvio** and enable it.
- **Google TV:** Use a file manager such as **Files by Marc** to locate and install the APK after downloading it.

---

### 8.3 Samsung Smart TV (Tizen / TizenBrew)

Samsung Tizen TVs do not support direct APK sideloading. Nuvio must be installed via **TizenBrew**.

- For full installation instructions, see the [Tizen Installation Guide](tizen-installation.md).
- If the app fails to load after installation, confirm TizenBrew is running the correct Nuvio Tizen build.
- Some Tizen features (hardware decoding, Dolby audio passthrough) depend on your TV model's capabilities.

> [!NOTE]
> Not all player features available on Android are available on Tizen due to platform limitations. Check the [Platform Compatibility](ui-customization.md) guide for a full feature comparison.

---

### 8.4 iOS / iPadOS

- Nuvio on iOS may require installation via **AltStore**, **Sideloadly**, or a similar sideloading tool, depending on the distribution method.
- If the app expires (a common issue with sideloaded iOS apps), re-sign it using your tool of choice.
- iOS has stricter background activity limits. Playback that pauses when the screen locks may require enabling **Background App Refresh** for Nuvio in iOS Settings.

---
