### Trakt Integration

Trakt syncs your watch history, progress, and personal lists across your devices. Nuvio supports both live syncing via the app and historical data importing via a web tool.

**How to Connect Trakt:**
You do not need to manually generate an API key for Trakt.
1. Navigate to **Integrations** > **Trakt**.
2. Click the **Connect Trakt** button. 
3. This will prompt you to sign in to your Trakt account and authorize Nuvio to access your profile.
4. Once connected, your status will update to show your Trakt username.

**Library and Sync Options:**
After authenticating, customize your tracking features. 

* **Library Source:** Choose which library to use for saving and viewing your collection. Options include **Trakt** or **Nuvio**.
* **Watch Progress:** Choose which progress source powers resume and continue watching. Options include **Trakt** or **Nuvio Sync**.

> [!NOTE]
> If you select **Nuvio Sync** as your primary watch progress source, Nuvio will still continue syncing your ongoing watch progress *to* Trakt in the background.

* **Continue Watching Window:** Define the Trakt history timeframe considered for continuing a show (e.g., 60 days).
* **Comments:** Toggle on to show Trakt user reviews on detail metadata pages.
