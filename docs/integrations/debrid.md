## Debrid Integration

Nuvio utilizes a centralized architecture for debrid integration. Instead of passing personal API keys to individual P2P scraping addons, accounts are linked directly within the core Nuvio Android and TV application. Nuvio intercepts the raw P2P hashes from your configured addons, verifies cache availability, and handles the link resolution natively by wrapping the addon in your debrid service.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Nuvio's debrid integration (TorBox or Premiumize) only resolves links — it cannot generate them on its own. You must have at least one **P2P-capable** scraper addon (such as AIOStreams, Comet, or Torrentio) installed and configured correctly, or Nuvio has nothing to wrap and resolve.

---

### Step 1: Accessing Connected Services
To begin configuring your debrid provider, open the application and navigate to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Connected Services**. This menu manages accounts for links and library access.

### Step 2: Linking an Account & Initial Toggles
By default, your debrid providers will show as unlinked, and core features will be disabled. 

1. Under the **Accounts** section, select either **Torbox** or **Premiumize**. Nuvio will prompt you to complete the account authorization via a browser window.
2. Once authenticated, the status will shift to **Connected**.
3. Under the **Connected Services** section, toggle **Cloud library** to **On** if you wish to browse and play media files already stored directly within your cloud provider's storage.
4. Toggle **Resolve playable links** to **On**. This allows Nuvio to actively request playable streaming links from your provider when scraping results.

---

### Step 3: Configuring AIOStreams & P2P Addons
Nuvio first needs a source to scrape the magnet links. You must configure your scraper addons **without** a Debrid API key and strictly in **P2P mode**. 

* [Detailed instructions on configuring a p2p Addon are located here](docs/addons/README.md)

---

### Step 4: Optimizing Link Preparation & Performance
When a provider is active, a **Link Preparation** section becomes available. 

* **Prepare links**: Toggle this **On** to resolve playable streams immediately before you hit playback, minimizing buffer delays.
* **Links to prepare**: Clicking this opens a configuration overlay. You can select between **1, 2, 3, or 5 links** to resolve concurrently. 

> [!WARNING]
> **Important Rate-Limit Advisory:** 
> It is highly recommended to use a lower link count (such as 2 links). Debrid providers strictly rate-limit how many resolution requests can be processed in a given timeframe. Simply opening a movie or episode details page pulls headers and counts toward those limits—even if you do not press "Watch"—because the links are actively prepared ahead of time.

---

### Step 5: Granular Result Management
Nuvio provides deep filtering and sorting configurations under the **Result Management** section to control exactly how scraped streams are indexed and presented:

#### Scraping & Capacity Limits
* **Max results**: Limits the total number of entries displayed (e.g., *All results*).
* **Sort results**: Dictates the primary arrangement hierarchy (e.g., *Original order*).
* **Per resolution / quality limit**: Caps repeating variants (e.g., duplicate 2160p or REMUX results) to clean up long scrape lists.
* **Size range**: Filters out files that fall outside specific file size thresholds.

#### The Three-Tier Filtering Architecture
For almost every media metric, Nuvio employs a strict prioritizing system split into **Preferred** (sorted to the top), **Required** (mandatory to display), and **Excluded** (hidden entirely). These settings are found directly under the capacity limits in the **Result Management** section:

| Metric | Configuration Scope |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Resolutions** | 4K (2160p), 1080p, 720p, etc. |
| **Qualities** | BluRay, WEB-DL, REMUX, HDTV, etc. |
| **Visual Tags** | Dolby Vision (DV), HDR, 10bit, IMAX, SDR, 3D. |
| **Audio Tags** | Atmos, TrueHD, DTS, AAC, etc. |
| **Channel Layouts** | 7.1, 5.1, Stereo, etc. |
| **Encodes** | AV1, HEVC (H.265), AVC (H.264). |
| **Languages & Groups** | Audio language tracks and specific release group tags. |

---

### Step 6: Metadata & UI Formatting
At the bottom of the Connected Services menu, the **Formatting** section allows you to customize the layout of the scraper results using variables:

* **Name template**: Customizes how the title and main text of the stream results appear. Leaving this blank defaults to the raw name provided by the scraper.
* **Description template**: Controls the structural display of metadata (bitrate, size, codec tags) displayed beneath each result.

### Why use Debrid?
1. **No Buffering:** Streams are served from high-speed data centers, not peer-to-peer.
2. **Quality:** Access to massive 4K/Remux files (60GB+) that are impossible to stream via standard public links.
3. **Safety:** The debrid service downloads the torrent on their servers; you only download/stream a private encrypted file from them.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It is highly recommended that you use a debrid service for safety and the best experience.

### Setup Steps
1. **Get an Account:** Sign up on the respective website.
2. **Retrieve API Key/Authorize:** Follow the individual provider's authorization steps.
3. **Configure Addons:** Most Nuvio addons will automatically detect your Debrid service once linked.

### Troubleshooting
* **"No Streams Found":** Check if your subscription has expired or if the addon supports your specific service.
* **"Authorization Failed":** Ensure you are logged into the website on your browser before entering the device code.
